}
\arguments{
\item{script}{script filename.}

\item{rm}{whether to remove all objects from the global environment before
the script is run.}

\item{quiet}{whether to suppress messages reporting progress.

By default, TAF scripts are run with \code{rm = TRUE} to make sure each
script starts with an empty workspace.}
}

without errors.
}
\description{
Use the knitr function \code{stitch()} to generate an html report of a single
TAF script.
}
\note{
Commands within a script may change the working directory, but
\code{stitchTAF} guarantees that after running a script, the working
directory reported by \code{getwd()} is the same before and after running a
script.
